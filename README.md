## The tech challenge

_You'll be asked of developing a small full-stack application (with both backend and frontend) using the best of your knowledges, taking into account best practices and code reusability.
We also want you to have fun with this!_

Take the test and submit your solution by adding @irysan to your repository. Please don't use the word Irysan on your repo name.
We're keen on reading your code, so take the test only if you want to!

### Test description

Create an app to see information about asteroids.
The app should:

- Display a list of asteroids
- Search by a range of dates
- See the detail of the asteroids by clicking on one of the items
- Sort the asteroids by name

Optional

- Add them to favourite
- Show a list of favourite
- Display details of favourite asteroids by click on the items form the list

_Don't forget that this must be a full-stack application._
We expect an app with the implementation of a backend and a frontend side.

Use the following API:

- <https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed?start_date=2015-09-07&end_date=2015-09-08&api_key=DEMO_KEY>

### SQL Tech challenge

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">Suppose you have a database with three tables: "users", "orders", and "products". The "users" table contains columns id, name, and email. The "orders" table contains columns id, user_id, product_id, quantity, and created_at. The "products" table contains columns id, name, price, and category.</span>

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">Write a single SQL query that returns a list of all users who have made at least 3 orders in the "Electronics" category and have spent more than $1000 on those orders, sorted by the total amount they have spent in descending order. The output should include the user's name, email, and the total amount they have spent on "Electronics" orders.</span>

##### Response:

<span style="font-size:1em;">Currently, after approximately 10 years since my last responsibility in a SQL project, I don't feel adequately prepared to tackle this challenge without the use of any modern AI tools. Attempting to do so would potentially create a false impression of my current knowledge in this area.</span>

<span style="font-size:1em;">I hope that the work accomplished in the full-stack challenge can offset this aspect.</span>
